# Laser Projekt Machine Learning 1

Author: Alexander Pieper

## How to run
To run this code in a terminal:
`export PYTHONPATH=.`, then `python Code/main.py`

## Goal:
Identify correct working lasers vs not correctly working lasers.

## Split:
We make a train test split of 60%/40%. So 120 Lasers will be taken to train the models and 80 will be use to evaluate the fit of the models.




# TODO's
- make .ipynb notebook aswell as the .py script
